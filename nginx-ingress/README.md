# nginx-ingress

These manifest files can be used to have an nginx-based ingress controller in your Kubernetes cluster. It's basically the standard nginx-ingress with some blocked user agents which stressed my apps in the past or which I simply dislike. 

If you hate Helm as much as I do, these manifest files will help you out.
