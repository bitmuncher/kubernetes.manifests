# kubernetes.manifests

Some k8s manifests for different stuff which worked for me. Since I'm not a big fan of Helm and often the stuff from the official helm repos don't work, I decided to pull some of the templates I use in my daily work and split them up into manifests.

Don't ask for support. As much as I liked to give support in the past, I don't have the time to deal with other people's problems at the moment. But if you use Kubernetes, you're probably a reasonably bright guy anyway. So you're for sure able to find a solution yourself if you just think about your problem a bit longer or try a bit.
